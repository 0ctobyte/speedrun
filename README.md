# speedrun

Final project for a high school computer science course. Completed June, 2010. Uses the Allegro game programming library.

## Build
- `mkdir build && cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`
- `make install` -> Just copies the binary and resources into a `install` sub directory

To run:
`cd install && ./speedrun`

Need to have Allegro 5 (5.0.11) and Chipmunk 6 (6.2.1) dev libraries installed.
